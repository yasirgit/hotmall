so I'm not sure now, is customer registration mandatory?
If he doesn't register, can he still redeem the coupon?

Another question - during registration he has tofill hist first and last name, phone and email.
But if he is already registered and wants only to log in, does he still need to fill all these information again?



Redeeming coupons
how many times can coupon be redeemed? Just once or multiple times?





Reports

yes, most of these reports can be trackable by Google Analytics, but it is not that simple 
to get the data from Google Analytics and report them to the users in the promocast system. 
I'm not sure if it's even possible to do it, at least in some simple way.

I think it would be simpler to givethe whitelabel users an option to use the Google Analytics 
tracking using their own account atGoogle Analytics - by just filling their analytics ID in siteadmin,
and then they'll be able to watch their analytics reports independently.

Some things, like coupons redemption, etc. can be tracked by Promocast.
