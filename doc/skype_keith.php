[10/26/2011 10:49:51 AM] Mark Fric: Hi! I’d like to add you on Skype. Maros Fric
[10/26/2011 4:45:45 PM] Keith Webb: Keith Webb has shared contact details with Mark Fric.
[10/26/2011 4:49:48 PM] Keith Webb: Hey man...thanks for adding me...William Tait has spoke highly of you and I would like to see if you could do some urgent work for us.  According to William, I really need to walk you through the whole system, so you have a good understanding of how it works.  Please contact me as soon as possible.  Either through Skype or mobile phone  214-728-7987
[10/26/2011 9:39:21 PM] Mark Fric: Hello Keith, do you have time now?
[10/26/2011 9:40:29 PM] Keith Webb: hey mark...how are you?
[10/26/2011 9:40:44 PM] Mark Fric: fine, thanks. and you?
[10/26/2011 9:43:42 PM] Keith Webb: William has spoken very highly of you, so I hope you can help me out.  We have a project like William was trying to create a while back.  We originally started with a directory script that we purchased, but as we added features, it became unstable so we started from scratch to create our own.  It's coming along (databases and html) almost complete, but we still need a lot of php programming and we are running out of time.  William already has several clients who want to use it (he started promoting it too soon!!! hehehe).  It is being written in codeignitor
[10/26/2011 9:45:03 PM] Mark Fric: i checked the website you sent to me, it seems to be relatively simple application. what is your deadline and do you have some list of tasks that have to be made?
[10/26/2011 9:45:05 PM] *** Keith Webb sent Promocast Outline.pdf ***
[10/26/2011 9:45:54 PM] Keith Webb: this is an outline of the project...here's the new site: http://akifquddus.com/localbargains/index.php
[10/26/2011 9:46:45 PM] Mark Fric: is there any difference to the web you sent to me before?
[10/26/2011 9:47:33 PM] Keith Webb: the original was not a very stable platform according to my programmer...this one is built from the ground up to be stable?!
[10/26/2011 9:47:50 PM] Keith Webb: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WNiFZH5GHbC8lSLb4AxjS_RIUI2krYaVvMHsOGtwJmo/edit?hl=en_US
[10/26/2011 9:51:44 PM] Keith Webb: do you mind if I add my guy "Trey" to the chat?
[10/26/2011 9:51:56 PM] Keith Webb: I don't know enough about programming
[10/26/2011 9:52:10 PM] Mark Fric: ok, sure
[10/26/2011 9:52:53 PM] Keith Webb: William had originally told client's september 30th, but that was before we started rebuilding it...now our "deadline" is November 15th

[10/26/2011 9:56:47 PM] Mark Fric: this document - Local Bargains.docx - is description of complete project, or only documentation what's left to be done?
[10/27/2011 3:43:35 PM] Keith Webb: Hey Maros, did you have any luck?
[10/27/2011 3:44:53 PM] Mark Fric: I'm still looking at it, I need some more time. 
can we talk again at similar time like yesterday?
[10/27/2011 3:45:43 PM] Keith Webb: so, it's 4:45 there, about what time and I'll schedule me off at work
[10/27/2011 3:46:56 PM] Mark Fric: would it be possible in 6 hours, at 10:46 our time?
[10/27/2011 3:47:16 PM] Keith Webb: ok, ttyl
[10/27/2011 3:47:32 PM] Mark Fric: ok, bye
[10/27/2011 3:55:39 PM] *** Keith Webb sent Promocast Outline - Word Theme.pdf ***
[10/27/2011 3:55:48 PM] Keith Webb: This may help also
[10/27/2011 3:55:54 PM] Mark Fric: ok, thanks
[10/27/2011 9:01:59 PM] Mark Fric: Hello Keith, do you have time now?
[10/27/2011 9:15:43 PM] Mark Fric: I looked at the siteadmin code you have so far, it seems to  be 
relatively easy to work with. 
I think it won't be a problem for us to make the siteadmin part.
I'm not really sure about the rest. The directory seems to be simple too, 
there might be some issues with payment processing, sending emails, affiliates tracking etc. that could take longer. 


There's one problem - I'm leaving for planned holidays tomorow and I'll come back on Monday evening. 
In addition to that, me and my team are finishing work on our own project and the planned release is also in the mid of November.

So I'll be away for the next 4 days and I'll be able to start with the development soonest on 1st of November and even then probably not full time.
Maybe i'll get some of my teammates to help me with the development, but it is not 100% sure - it will depend on the workload of our own project.

It is quite difficult situation, the timing isn't very good. If we had more time we'd be able to make the whole project even from scratch without problems.


I still don't have overview of the project as a whole so I can estimate it only very roughly.
There is a risk that I'll promise something I won't be able to deliver, and I want to avoid that.


So what I can offer you - we can start with the development on 1st of November, we'll try to make as much as possible within the first November week. 
If there'll be no big problems I assume we can have most of the siteadmin functionality ready within the first week - so the siteadmin will work like in the old version.
(I mean the web pages and forms, I'm not sure about background tasks like sending emails, tracking, etc.)
Now I cannot plan beyond the first week, but during this week we'll also learn much more about the system and I'll be able to plan the rest of the work.
Generally we'd have two more weeks until the deadline, so we should make it.   


Now about money. Our price is $60 per development hour, I know it is not really cheap. Is that acceptable for you?
I'll not charge you anything if within the first week  we'll find out that we aren't able to do it for any reason  
or if you'll be not satisfied with the work.

We'll be able to provide also future maintenance and updates if you'll be interested.
[10/27/2011 9:16:01 PM] Keith Webb: cool
[10/27/2011 9:18:14 PM] Keith Webb: how many development hours do you expect the task to take?
[10/27/2011 9:18:18 PM] Keith Webb: On your end
[10/27/2011 9:20:14 PM] Mark Fric: that's very hard to estimate now, as I said I don't have full overview about the whole system.
very rough estimation - siteadmin should take about 60-80 hours, directory maybe half of it, and i don't have idea about the rest
[10/27/2011 9:22:10 PM] Keith Webb: Ok, so just to be clear, your team can start November 1 and work that whole week.  During this week, you'll probably be able to get the siteadmin done...right?  So, what should I have my guys do between now and then that will help complete the project on time?
[10/27/2011 9:23:21 PM] Keith Webb: please be as specific as possible so I can pass this along to Trey
[10/27/2011 9:26:32 PM] Mark Fric: yes, we'll be most probably able to finish siteadmin within this week, at least from the bigger part. 
I'm not sure about your programmers, maybe they can work on the directory part (I'm not sure if that if completely finished now or not), or work on the tasks like payment processing and sending emails

In fact why you want to try us, aren't your programmers able to do the project by themselves?
[10/27/2011 9:28:25 PM] Keith Webb: yes, but since we don' t have a team of our own, we're trying to manage programmers all over the world that are working only part time and this is very difficult
[10/27/2011 9:28:47 PM] Keith Webb: we've never needed a team before
[10/27/2011 9:32:00 PM] Mark Fric: I see. well, we can maybe continually take over the project and maintain it in thefuture if you'll be interested.

It would be best if your programmers could do the background tasks, because these require better understanding of the system than I have now.
[10/27/2011 9:33:32 PM] Keith Webb: ok, I'll get together with Trey and have him make sure those tasks are completed...maybe there is hope of this being completed by November 15th :)
[10/27/2011 9:34:15 PM] Keith Webb: Is there ANYTHING else you need before you get started.  Do you want me to send you another more detailed outline of the project
[10/27/2011 9:34:22 PM] Keith Webb: I'm working on doing that now
[10/27/2011 9:34:48 PM] Keith Webb: I'm adding notes, etc to that pdf outline that I sent you
[10/27/2011 9:36:14 PM] Mark Fric: well, yes, please send me any additional information you have.
[10/27/2011 9:37:03 PM] Keith Webb: do have access to all the databases, etc now or does Trey need to send you something else...I'm not for sure what he set you up with yesterday
[10/27/2011 9:38:28 PM] Mark Fric: I have a copy of database and complete source code. I don't have access to the site online, but I think I don't need that now.
[10/27/2011 9:39:23 PM] Mark Fric: can you take some time now to give me some answers?I can tell you how I understand it and you can correct me or add something to it
[10/27/2011 9:39:41 PM] Keith Webb: sure, I'll answer the best I can
[10/27/2011 9:40:45 PM] Mark Fric: ok, so generally you want to run a site like localbargains.mobi. Would it be just one site or would it be multiple sites on a different domains?
[10/27/2011 9:42:42 PM] Keith Webb: a person will be able to be have a white label version using their domain that is hosted on our installation of this script
[10/27/2011 9:43:27 PM] Mark Fric: i see. so each installation will run the site for one domain right? and each installation has its own siteadmin?
[10/27/2011 9:43:54 PM] Keith Webb: yes
[10/27/2011 9:44:12 PM] Keith Webb: sorry, only one installation but each will have its own site admin..
[10/27/2011 9:45:04 PM] Mark Fric: so there'll be just on einstallation of the system, and it will handle multiple domains?
[10/27/2011 9:45:19 PM] Keith Webb: exactly
[10/27/2011 9:46:14 PM] Mark Fric: ok, and where do you configure these domains, etc.? I don't remember seeing it in siteadmin
[10/27/2011 9:49:03 PM] Keith Webb: godaddy.com and point A record to the dns
[10/27/2011 9:49:30 PM] Keith Webb: or the customer's domain registar instead of godaddy...sorry
[10/27/2011 9:49:57 PM] Mark Fric: ok, so everybody who runs his own domain will get access to the siteadmin andhe'll be able to manage his own directory
[10/27/2011 9:50:22 PM] Keith Webb: yes
[10/27/2011 9:51:20 PM] Keith Webb: but we'll have super admin priviledges and be able to access ALL admin areas
[10/27/2011 9:52:34 PM] Mark Fric: hm. but how will it be made technically? will it work again through siteadmin? 
so that you'll log in as superadmin and you'll see all thelocations, advertisers, etc.?
[10/27/2011 9:53:05 PM] Keith Webb: yes, correct
[10/27/2011 9:53:56 PM] Keith Webb: [Thursday, October 27, 2011 9:53 PM] Trey Brister: 

<<< A directory or a listing is a resource.  it is also mapped to the loc_users_info table
[10/27/2011 9:54:25 PM] Keith Webb: [Thursday, October 27, 2011 9:54 PM] Trey Brister: 

<<< in the resource_types_users_table
[10/27/2011 9:55:35 PM] Keith Webb: Also, while I'm thinking about it, can you write a small affiliate program for the system since we don't need a large one?
[10/27/2011 9:57:13 PM] Keith Webb: I've got appointments waiting on me, so I've added Trey..I'll brb
[10/27/2011 9:57:15 PM] Keith Webb: sorry
[10/27/2011 9:57:26 PM] Mark Fric: ok, no problem
[11/1/2011 2:07:27 PM] Keith Webb: Hey Maros, let me know when you get a chance to speak. Thanks!!!
[11/2/2011 5:22:08 AM] Keith Webb: hey maros
[11/2/2011 5:22:28 AM] Keith Webb: did you get the information that I sent you?
[11/2/2011 5:30:25 AM] Mark Fric: hello Keith
[11/2/2011 5:30:58 AM] Keith Webb: hey man
[11/2/2011 5:31:06 AM] Keith Webb: how was your time off?
[11/2/2011 5:31:26 AM] Mark Fric: it was great, I was in the mountains and we had very nice weather.
[11/2/2011 5:31:51 AM] Keith Webb: wow...we don't have any mountains around us...
[11/2/2011 5:32:21 AM] Mark Fric: we neither, we had to go about 400 miles by car
[11/2/2011 5:32:48 AM] Mark Fric: I got your email. I'll look at the affiliate part.
[11/2/2011 5:33:06 AM] Mark Fric: but there are few things I'm concerned with
[11/2/2011 5:33:16 AM] Keith Webb: such as?
[11/2/2011 5:36:30 AM] Mark Fric: i had time to think abotut the project and the database, and I think the database model is not good. 
I don't want to criticize Trey, I just give you my professional opinion. 
For example, users are stored in 10 tables! 
It is extremely fragmented, and while it might be very flexible, it will be also much more complicated to work with. Usually there's no need for very big flexibility, for example in Post Affiliate Pro we had just one table for users.

And this is just one example.
[11/2/2011 5:37:15 AM] Mark Fric: but i understand that it would be impossible to change te table model now.
[11/2/2011 5:38:02 AM] Keith Webb: what would you suggest?  should we complete this one and then redo the databases on the next version?
[11/2/2011 5:40:34 AM] Mark Fric: well, that is the question. it would mean you'll make the third version of the same application, because db model changes everything

isn't there an option to deliver the older version (perhaps with added functionality) at the deadline? 
and then make the new version when there's more time for that?
[11/2/2011 5:42:51 AM] Keith Webb: that's a tough one to answer...because we've got some pretty big clients that area wanting to use it and if they aren't happy, we'll loose a lot of money.  How long would it take to start over and get back to the place we are now with the new database?
[11/2/2011 5:43:36 AM] Keith Webb: And how many developer hours would it be so I can determine costs
[11/2/2011 5:44:14 AM] Mark Fric: but is there anything new in this new version that isnt in the old one? I was under impression that you just want to copy the functionality as the firststep to make it to the deadline
[11/2/2011 5:45:50 AM] Keith Webb: Only a few minor changes on the front end, but a whole new look to the backend. Trey said that the other was very unstable and took longer to fix the bugs than to redo it
[11/2/2011 5:48:20 AM] Mark Fric: hmm, I haven't looked how the old version is programmed, but usually it is very simple to change the look, you'l justchange some HTML and you can do quite a lot by just applying CSS styles.. 
I don't think it would take that much time, but I repeat, I haven't looked at the od version code yet.
[11/2/2011 5:49:16 AM] Keith Webb: if we turned the whole project over to you, how long do you think it would take for you to complete the new one and how much would it cost
[11/2/2011 5:49:58 AM] Keith Webb: have you seen what has been completed since we last spoke?
[11/2/2011 5:50:23 AM] Mark Fric: no, I havent looked it yet
[11/2/2011 5:50:27 AM] Keith Webb: I know Trey hired a couple of guys that are supposed to be very good
[11/2/2011 5:52:39 AM] Keith Webb: Do you still have to leave next week for the other project?
[11/2/2011 5:53:31 AM] Mark Fric: i understand. it is possible.
but if you want to have a stable and maintainedproduct, in my opinion it is not good to rely on external developers who can leave anytime

if Trey is able to finish the project then you don't need us, and in fact it would be better if the work is done by just one group of programmers
[11/2/2011 5:53:48 AM] Mark Fric: if we'll make the project from scratch we'll surely not make it until 15th November.
[11/2/2011 5:54:34 AM] Mark Fric: I don't have to leave, I can concentrate on your project, anf my colleagues can work on it partially
[11/2/2011 5:54:52 AM] Keith Webb: I would prefer someone like you and your team handle it if possible...can you give me a timeframe and costs
[11/2/2011 5:57:33 AM] Mark Fric: ok. my estimation is that it would take about 6-8 manweeks (5 days x 8 hours per week), and so the cost would be about 15-20.000 USD
[11/2/2011 5:58:27 AM] Keith Webb: How many people could you have work on it...what's the quickest it could be done
[11/2/2011 5:59:01 AM] Keith Webb: so if you had 8 guys...you could have it done by next week...hehehe
[11/2/2011 6:00:03 AM] Mark Fric: no, unfortunately not :) i can have 3 people working on it, but it won't  reduce the time required by 3. I think 3-4 weeks is the minimum to complete the project
[11/2/2011 6:00:56 AM] Keith Webb: what could we do that would help you out?  could we still have them work on the front end?
[11/2/2011 6:01:06 AM] Keith Webb: or is it better not
[11/2/2011 6:01:18 AM] Keith Webb: I think all the html is done
[11/2/2011 6:01:58 AM] Mark Fric: we'd have to make the programming by ourselves. we can use the HTML if that's finished, but the code is dependent on DB model
[11/2/2011 6:02:15 AM] Mark Fric: and what about the deadline on 15th?
[11/2/2011 6:02:17 AM] Keith Webb: k
[11/2/2011 6:02:50 AM] Keith Webb: hmmm...that's a tough one...I'll have to see if William can work his magic and push it back another 2 weeks
[11/2/2011 6:03:11 AM] Keith Webb: maybe if we got the 1st version up and somewhat stable?
[11/2/2011 6:03:27 AM] Mark Fric: you mean on 15th?
[11/2/2011 6:03:35 AM] Keith Webb: yep
[11/2/2011 6:04:28 AM] Mark Fric: ok, there can be some first version on 15th, perhaps with some missing functionality (like affiliates, or other less important things), but stable
[11/2/2011 6:04:58 AM] Keith Webb: when would you start?
[11/2/2011 6:06:20 AM] Mark Fric: i can start today. as the very first step I'll make more detailed specification of the project, write down all tasks that have to be done
[11/2/2011 6:07:34 AM] Mark Fric: then i'll be able to estimate the work exactly. 
so maybe you can wait with the decision until I'll have this and you'll see if you'll accept the time and price of development
[11/2/2011 6:08:41 AM] Keith Webb: that's sounds good...what is the best time for me to reach you on your time.  Do you work during the day, night or what?  I notice that its 6am there are you a morning person?
[11/2/2011 6:09:34 AM] Mark Fric: yes, sometimes I wake up very early :)
I can have it ready this evening, at around 9-10pm my time
[11/2/2011 6:09:58 AM] Keith Webb: k, do you have the program mindmap?
[11/2/2011 6:10:29 AM] Mark Fric: what do you mean by mindmap?
[11/2/2011 6:10:33 AM] *** Keith Webb sent Promocast Outline.mmap ***
[11/2/2011 6:11:18 AM] Keith Webb: that pdf is a mindmap that I built with Mindjet Mindmanager program...I don't know if this will help you or not, but here it is
[11/2/2011 6:11:48 AM] Mark Fric: ok, I'll look at it.
[11/2/2011 6:12:07 AM] Keith Webb: would you please look at the database. I know they were working on it while you were gone...maybe they fixed it?
[11/2/2011 6:13:05 AM] Keith Webb: doubtful but possible
[11/2/2011 6:13:31 AM] Mark Fric: i'll look at it, but i don't think they simpified and changed the model
[11/2/2011 6:15:38 AM] Keith Webb: k, so I'll make sure I'm around between 9-10pm your time...that will give me a chance to ok the price and set back with my partner and William.  Also, William is using post affiliate pro on the back end of his new website and wanted to make sure promocast will be able to integrate with it
[11/2/2011 6:16:36 AM] Keith Webb: he said it's the latest version and know that you weren't involved with it, but said that you'll probably know how
[11/2/2011 6:17:33 AM] Mark Fric: sorry, i don't know promocast, so I cannot answer that
[11/2/2011 6:18:26 AM] Mark Fric: can I ask few questions about the program now?
[11/2/2011 6:18:42 AM] Keith Webb: promocast is what we are calling the system you are working on
[11/2/2011 6:18:45 AM] Keith Webb: our system
[11/2/2011 6:18:52 AM] Keith Webb: sure
[11/2/2011 6:19:12 AM] Mark Fric: i see. so youwant to make the affiliat epart using post affiliat epro?
[11/2/2011 6:20:10 AM] Keith Webb: just so they integrate...Promocast dont need to have to be that sophisticated but we want to pull the data in
[11/2/2011 6:22:39 AM] Mark Fric: but what exactly you mean by integration? 
there are two ways - either we'll make our own simple affiliate program in promocast, or we'll use PAP. both ways are possible, and promocast can be integrated with PAP.
the problem with PAP would be that it is an external program, so affiliates will be not a part of siteadmin.
its advantage is that it is very powerful, but as I checked the affiliate system you want to use, it is quite simple
[11/2/2011 6:24:02 AM] Keith Webb: so it will be external to this site, but they will just access it from our links?
[11/2/2011 6:24:26 AM] Mark Fric: you mean affiliates?
[11/2/2011 6:24:29 AM] Keith Webb: yes
[11/2/2011 6:24:48 AM] Mark Fric: yes, you can give them link to signup and log in to the affiliate panel
[11/2/2011 6:25:03 AM] Keith Webb: k, I'll check with William on that ok?
[11/2/2011 6:25:26 AM] Keith Webb: what were your questions about the program?
[11/2/2011 6:26:56 AM] Mark Fric: there are few things I havent found in the existing db model.
last time you said that you'll have ine installation of the program and it will handle multiple websites(domains). 
It will look as if each website has its own installation of promocast. did I undersatnd it right?
[11/2/2011 6:28:26 AM] Keith Webb: hold on..I'm going to send you the conversation between William and Trey...they were discussing this subject
[11/2/2011 6:28:37 AM] Mark Fric: ok
[11/2/2011 6:33:45 AM] Keith Webb: 3:45:05 PM] Mark Fric: so there'll be just on einstallation of the system, and it will handle multiple domains?

[3:45:19 PM] Keith Webb: exactly

[3:46:15 PM] Mark Fric: ok, and where do you configure these domains, etc.? I don't remember seeing it in siteadmin

[3:49:03 PM] Keith Webb: godaddy.com and point A record to the dns

[3:49:30 PM] Keith Webb: or the customer's domain registar instead of godaddy...sorry

[3:49:58 PM] Mark Fric: ok, so everybody who runs his own domain will get access to the siteadmin andhe'll be able to manage his own directory

[3:50:22 PM] Keith Webb: yes

[3:51:21 PM] Keith Webb: but we'll have super admin priviledges and be able to access ALL admin areas

[3:52:35 PM] Mark Fric: hm. but how will it be made technically? will it work again through siteadmin?

so that you'll log in as superadmin and you'll see all thelocations, advertisers, etc.?

William: I don’t think this is right. White label domains would point their nameservers at promocast servers and then it would be setup through site admin by promocast admin. You need to control the zone file not them. So you create a dns server on your server named promocast-dms.com that manages all the entities - once pointed, you create a domain hosting account on your server. 

Trey: Here is the big problem with that. If they point name servers, then they must use their entire domain with us and we must support their email.  Plus we have the added maintenance of setting them up on our server. If they point A record then as long as localbargains.mobi has dedicated IP address they only need to setup their domain name in the directory admin. Plus they can point subdomain if they want and we are not responsible for their server or DNS working. Plus we are not responsible for their email. 
Either way they have to change settings in their domain registrar. This way they can use cpanel or their domain registrar to point an A record to us and we dont have to do anything.

William: I don’t see that as a problem. All they need do is register a .net domain and repoint that. If you control the zone file you have more control over the dns and subsequent tracking – otherwise everything is scattered all over the Internet and you lose control of the TTL. Plus you can create canonicals as required for new systems. Hosting your own dns server is nothing – just add the domains through cpanel. everything is on the one server then – all roads lead to Rome.

Trey: Here is what I heard from your words. o mitigate the issue of email you suggest the customer purchases a new domain name or we buy it for them. And also the extra step of us having to add their domain into cpanel is outweighed by the benefits of tracking enhancement. As I understand it.  If they point an A record all traffic goes to our IP address where it will be tracked.  Since any traffic on the DNS server prior to reaching our IP address is not tracked by Local Bargains...
Can you please explain the benefit from a tracking perspective of us hosting their DNS on our name servers and how it will DNS server traffic get entered into our log and how that (Time To Live) TTL info helps us. 

William: TTL can have a dramatic effect on tracking results. If set too high, server caching becomes an issue with changes. If set to low the TTL can expire the packet in transit. If you don’t control the zone file there’s no way to control the environment. Moreover, imagine what the dns routing table could look like with clients in other countries?  Now a simple answer to this is to use a canonical e.g. yourdomainname.promocast.com – now you control everything.  If they don’t like that they can upgrade to a premium package for an additional fee. 
Talk to Maros about ad tracking methodologies and problems associated with ad tracking.  For this type of development he’s an expert.  Also talk to Direct Track in Pittsburgh (Jeff Stevens) DT is probably the worlds leading tracking system. The bottom line is if promocast doesn’t track results 99% correctly it’s history.  That goes for any ad tracking platform.

Trey: OK i'm convinced, what is the recommend workflow when applying do we: 1. Do we purchase their domain.  If so how do we setup API to register their domain? 2. If they buy their own domain how would we check to see if its pointed at the correct name server during advertiser registration. Also can you think of a way to automatically add their domain to our cpanel DNS server after this initial check.

William: This is a question for Keith, but my suggestion is to offer during the signup process a field that asks them to input their preferred name extension [name].promocast.com and alternatively a checkbox indicating they wish to use their own domain name and a textbox for them to input. Provide the nameserver addresses, a brief descript about pointing and a warning regarding existing site content, email, etc. 

Trey: Great answer, Thanks William.
[11/2/2011 6:35:09 AM] Keith Webb: So I guess we're going with Williams way...
[11/2/2011 6:39:46 AM] Keith Webb: what do you think?
[11/2/2011 6:41:05 AM] Mark Fric: ok, this is the technical point of view, but it doesn;t answer my question.
it doesn't matter how DNS is solved, you'l have multiple sites and my question is if you want to have just one installation of the system to handle all domains, or if therecan be installation of the ssytem for each domain. Both have their pros and cons.
One installation:
- much more complicates, there should be some super admin panel that will allow creation of the new "sites"

- problems with customizations - if one customer wants to customize the theme of functionality it is not trivial to make in when the sam eapplication is used also by the others
 
Multiple installations:
- simple
- easier to customize
- harder to update to newer versions and apply fixes
[11/2/2011 6:41:41 AM] Mark Fric: how many clients to do expect to have?
[11/2/2011 6:42:07 AM] Keith Webb: thousands
[11/2/2011 6:42:34 AM] Mark Fric: ok, so then it has to be one installation.
[11/2/2011 6:42:35 AM] Keith Webb: William is already talking about 5000+ within the next few months
[11/2/2011 6:43:12 AM] Mark Fric: by customers we mean people who want to run their own "copy" of promocast, right?
[11/2/2011 6:43:57 AM] Keith Webb: yes, he's got a restaurant that has 2300 locations and 1200 hotels that all may want their own location/system
[11/2/2011 6:44:40 AM] Mark Fric: ok, I see. was this handled in some way in the old system?
[11/2/2011 6:45:05 AM] Keith Webb: we never launched the old system...so no
[11/2/2011 6:45:18 AM] Keith Webb: it was just the original idea
[11/2/2011 6:46:23 AM] Mark Fric: ok, because this adds whole new level of compexity to the system. 
it is not simple to make this work right. We were doing something similar with hosted version fo PAP
[11/2/2011 6:47:38 AM] Mark Fric: i think I underestimated the work on the system then
[11/2/2011 6:48:36 AM] Mark Fric: i haven't seen anyfunctionality for this in the new application either, as far as I remember there's no administration of the domains there
[11/2/2011 6:49:13 AM] Keith Webb: I'm not for sure..I know they were making a super admin area
[11/2/2011 6:49:25 AM] Mark Fric: ok, I haven't seen that
[11/2/2011 6:51:05 AM] Mark Fric: so generally you want users to sign up for your application, and they'll use the domain something.promocast.com
Each of them will b ethen able to create their own locations, etc.
[11/2/2011 6:51:07 AM] Mark Fric: right?
[11/2/2011 6:53:05 AM] Keith Webb: Well, my understanding is that they will not be able to created their own locations because each location is another copy of the program.  They will only be able to create their own categories and subcategories and the advertisers will only be able to create their listings and promotions
[11/2/2011 6:53:40 AM] Keith Webb: each location is an installation and another licensing fee
[11/2/2011 6:54:26 AM] Keith Webb: only we are able to create a location
[11/2/2011 6:54:34 AM] Mark Fric: I see now. so every location will also have their own domain ro subdomain?
[11/2/2011 6:54:40 AM] Keith Webb: yes
[11/2/2011 6:54:49 AM] Mark Fric: i see, i get it now
[11/2/2011 6:54:59 AM] Keith Webb: is that easier?
[11/2/2011 6:55:12 AM] Mark Fric: yes, it is. I have to think about it all
[11/2/2011 6:55:41 AM] Keith Webb: k, anything else...I'm dead
[11/2/2011 6:56:08 AM] Mark Fric: ok, sorry. I think I got everything I need
[11/2/2011 6:56:15 AM] Keith Webb: that pdf has the super admin stuff on it too
[11/2/2011 6:56:30 AM] Mark Fric: ok, i'll look at it
[11/2/2011 6:56:49 AM] Keith Webb: dude, I'm not going until I've answered all your questions...you are my #1 priority
[11/2/2011 6:57:05 AM] Keith Webb: I can sleep when I'm dead
[11/2/2011 6:57:14 AM] Keith Webb: hehehe
[11/2/2011 6:57:15 AM] Mark Fric: haha, ok
[11/2/2011 6:57:53 AM] Keith Webb: So I'm at work between 9am and 6pm my time...so just hit me up on skype when you need something
[11/2/2011 6:58:21 AM] Mark Fric: ok. I don't have more questions rigth now, I think I know everything I need
[11/2/2011 6:59:04 AM] Mark Fric: maybe about the affiliates how it will be handled,. butyou said you'll talk to william about that
[11/2/2011 6:59:40 AM] Keith Webb: so, should I have Trey tell his guys to take tomorrow off until we come to an agreement... or do you want to hit me up in my morning and tell me what I can have them work on once you look at what they have?
[11/2/2011 7:00:14 AM] Keith Webb: 7 more hours
[11/2/2011 7:00:21 AM] Keith Webb: at 8am my time
[11/2/2011 7:01:13 AM] Mark Fric: i think we can come to agreement in themorning your time. does Trey work at night?
[11/2/2011 7:02:43 AM] Keith Webb: hell no...hehehe...he's so ugly, he needs his beauty sleep
[11/2/2011 7:03:13 AM] Keith Webb: I just emailed william and told him to contact you asap
[11/2/2011 7:03:24 AM] Keith Webb: about the affiliate program
[11/2/2011 7:03:31 AM] Mark Fric: i think you should not stop their work until we come to an agreement.
but I'll most probably not use anything they made so far
[11/2/2011 7:04:16 AM] Keith Webb: I'll hit you up when I wake up...I may just have them stop for now
[11/2/2011 7:04:25 AM] Mark Fric: ok
[11/2/2011 7:04:33 AM] Keith Webb: ttyl...goodnight
[11/2/2011 7:04:46 AM] Mark Fric: ok, good night
[11/2/2011 12:58:17 PM] Keith Webb: did you take a peak at the current database?
[11/2/2011 12:59:09 PM] Mark Fric: not yet, but I can do it now
[11/2/2011 12:59:45 PM] Keith Webb: ok, I'm going to take a shower...I'll hit you up in about 20-30 minutes
[11/2/2011 1:00:48 PM] Mark Fric: ok
[11/2/2011 1:26:48 PM] Keith Webb: im back
[11/2/2011 1:27:19 PM] *** Mark Fric sent work_plan_estimation.xlsx ***
[11/2/2011 1:27:36 PM] Mark Fric: ok. i made more exact estimation
[11/2/2011 1:28:43 PM] Keith Webb: a media broker IS an affiliate...William just wanted to call them something else to make people think its something cool
[11/2/2011 1:28:46 PM] Keith Webb: hehehe
[11/2/2011 1:29:11 PM] Mark Fric: i thought so. but it is unsure now if affiliates will be handled by theprogram or by PAP
[11/2/2011 1:30:12 PM] Keith Webb: the white label user will be able to send auto-responder messages to new advertisers when they sign up.
[11/2/2011 1:30:32 PM] Keith Webb: they decide what and when to send them
[11/2/2011 1:31:17 PM] Mark Fric: i see. but then there's not enough configuration for that. there are just 3 editable messages, but nowhere to specify when the messages should be sent
[11/2/2011 1:31:53 PM] Mark Fric: white label user = location ?
[11/2/2011 1:32:02 PM] Keith Webb: yes
[11/2/2011 1:32:15 PM] Keith Webb: let me ask, will we be able to use ANY of the existing code
[11/2/2011 1:33:33 PM] Mark Fric: I'm not sure, I have to look at it. maybe, but most probably only some small pieces. you wanted to build the system from scratch, not improve old scripts
[11/2/2011 1:33:58 PM] Keith Webb: yes, but I know they've got the payment processor integration, etc
[11/2/2011 1:34:13 PM] Mark Fric: yes, things like that can be used
[11/2/2011 1:34:17 PM] Keith Webb: k
[11/2/2011 1:35:04 PM] Mark Fric: I have a question - if advertiser pays for the plan, do the money go to white label user or to you?
[11/2/2011 1:36:07 PM] Keith Webb: whitelabel
[11/2/2011 1:36:50 PM] Mark Fric: but how will it be made? then white label user would have to have some contract with payment gateway
[11/2/2011 1:37:06 PM] Mark Fric: or it will go to you and you'll send it to him
[11/2/2011 1:37:42 PM] Keith Webb: no they will each be able to put in their paypal info and authorize.net gateway info...money goes directly to them
[11/2/2011 1:37:51 PM] Keith Webb: WHITE LABEL STATISTICS:

The customer with the most points will be shown first and then the rest in descending order depending on the sum of their points
[11/2/2011 1:38:23 PM] Mark Fric: i see. will they also have separate affiliates or affiliate program is just one for all locations?
[11/2/2011 1:38:31 PM] Keith Webb: separate
[11/2/2011 1:39:50 PM] Mark Fric: then it would be difficult to use PAP, it would be very difficult to split the affiliate programs to separate locations. PAP is good for running one affiliate program
[11/2/2011 1:40:38 PM] Mark Fric: what is Device ID, Device Location, Device Sub-Location?
[11/2/2011 1:42:04 PM] Keith Webb: that's the proximity marketing device information.  For example, lets say it was set up in the the northeast corner of a mall and it was the 6th device in that network.  Device ID = 6, Location = Northpark Mall, Sublocation = Northeast corner
[11/2/2011 1:42:13 PM] Keith Webb: brb
[11/2/2011 1:51:25 PM] Keith Webb: ok, im back
[11/2/2011 1:51:47 PM] Keith Webb: trying to get my son ready for school
[11/2/2011 1:52:05 PM] Mark Fric: I see. is it morning your time?
[11/2/2011 1:52:13 PM] Keith Webb: yep
[11/2/2011 1:52:29 PM] Keith Webb: im 6 hours behind you
[11/2/2011 1:53:16 PM] Mark Fric: i see.
these devices and locations, sublocations are configured anywhere? I haven't seen them in siteadmin
[11/2/2011 1:54:09 PM] Keith Webb: william configures them at the factory...we just bring in that information for identification of the device
[11/2/2011 1:55:59 PM] Mark Fric: ok, but how is it related to your system? it looks like this statistics description belongs to another project. for example Promos, Employees also aren't in the siteadmin
[11/2/2011 1:56:57 PM] Keith Webb: well it's not really related...it's just a way that the white label person can identify which device that information came from for tracking purposes
[11/2/2011 1:57:39 PM] Keith Webb: which platform will you be using codeignitor, kohana, yii?
[11/2/2011 1:57:50 PM] Mark Fric: i would prefer yii
[11/2/2011 1:57:58 PM] Keith Webb: k
[11/2/2011 1:58:18 PM] Keith Webb: so it will be easy to add additional functions done the road yes?
[11/2/2011 1:58:24 PM] Keith Webb: down the road
[11/2/2011 1:59:04 PM] Mark Fric: yes, it would be made in a way that it would be extendable with new functionality
[11/2/2011 1:59:28 PM] Mark Fric: do you alreadyhave some plan for additional functions?
[11/2/2011 2:00:14 PM] Keith Webb: not anything that wasn't on that list, but William spoke with a company that has some hotels that wanted some different things added...not for sure what they are
[11/2/2011 2:01:01 PM] Mark Fric: i see. it will be possible
[11/2/2011 2:02:08 PM] Keith Webb: what parts WILL NOT be done by nov 15?
[11/2/2011 2:03:21 PM] Mark Fric: that's difficult to say, we can concentrate on the most important features first. what is the biggest and least priority for you?
[11/2/2011 2:03:39 PM] Keith Webb: I'll have to think about that one
[11/2/2011 2:03:45 PM] Keith Webb: and let you know
[11/2/2011 2:04:00 PM] Mark Fric: things like autoresponders, newsletters will be left for later, also affiliates
[11/2/2011 2:04:08 PM] Keith Webb: k, anything else for now?  I'll speak with my partner and William (if I can get hold of him) and discuss the situation.  Would your team start tomorrow/today?
[11/2/2011 2:04:59 PM] Mark Fric: we can start tomorow if we'll make agreement. I'll use the time today to prepare the development environment and make application skeleton
[11/2/2011 2:05:14 PM] Mark Fric: database, etc.
[11/2/2011 2:05:36 PM] Keith Webb: k, I'm sure we probably will but I need to confirm
[11/2/2011 2:06:09 PM] Keith Webb: I also need to have a discussion with Trey...he's tried very hard and I don't want him to feel bad
[11/2/2011 2:06:23 PM] Mark Fric: yes, i understand
[11/2/2011 2:06:38 PM] Keith Webb: Would you be available for him if he has any questions about why we would start over?
[11/2/2011 2:06:55 PM] Mark Fric: hmm, ok
[11/2/2011 2:07:02 PM] Keith Webb: k, ttyl
[11/2/2011 2:07:09 PM] Mark Fric: ok, bye
[11/2/2011 3:05:28 PM] Keith Webb: Ok, I spoke with Trey...he said it would actually be a relief for him if you took over, but wanted to know what was wrong with the database for when he does things in the future.  He will be contacting you to get your opinion
[11/2/2011 3:06:41 PM] Keith Webb: did william contact you last night?
[11/2/2011 3:10:10 PM] Mark Fric: i'm talking to trey now
[11/2/2011 3:15:40 PM] Mark Fric: ok, i finished
[11/2/2011 3:16:22 PM] Mark Fric: no, william didn't contact me last night
[11/2/2011 3:29:26 PM] Mark Fric: do youhave time now for  few questions?
[11/2/2011 3:29:47 PM] Keith Webb: give me a couple of minutes
[11/2/2011 3:29:52 PM] Mark Fric: ok
[11/2/2011 3:53:22 PM] Keith Webb: you there?
[11/2/2011 3:53:35 PM] Mark Fric: yes
[11/2/2011 3:53:44 PM] Keith Webb: what did you decide
[11/2/2011 3:53:56 PM] Keith Webb: I just got off the phone with Trey
[11/2/2011 3:54:17 PM] Mark Fric: yes? what was i supposed to decide?
[11/2/2011 3:55:50 PM] Keith Webb: He said that you could actually correct the existing database...or do you definately want to start over?
[11/2/2011 3:57:00 PM] Mark Fric: yes, if I'd work on the project I'd start over. I don't like the existing database model.
[11/2/2011 3:58:28 PM] Keith Webb: ok, also...could you do local development and push to our server using mercurial for source control?  He said it could be set up very quickly and would help if needed...he said it had several advantages
[11/2/2011 3:59:05 PM] Mark Fric: is mymobiplan.com your server?
[11/2/2011 3:59:10 PM] Keith Webb: yes
[11/2/2011 3:59:47 PM] Mark Fric: hmm. i'm not used to use mercurial, I use subversion. is it a problem?
[11/2/2011 4:00:27 PM] Keith Webb: he just said that mercurial had several advantages over subversion, could you give it a shot?
[11/2/2011 4:03:26 PM] Mark Fric: well, frankly, i think it is not important at all what versioning system is used. 
I use subversion and I know it, I dont see any reason to switch to mercurial. every versioning system has its advantages and disadvantages.

If I'll get FTP access to your server then there's no problem. I can also giveyou access to my subversion account so you can access the sourcecodes
[11/2/2011 4:04:26 PM] Keith Webb: brb...i've got a client up front
[11/2/2011 4:11:05 PM] Keith Webb: ok, np
[11/2/2011 4:12:22 PM] Mark Fric: so do youhave time now for a few questions?
[11/2/2011 4:12:30 PM] Keith Webb: one of the new guys is VERY familiar with yii and really knows his shit according to Trey, could he work on the less important stuff that wasn't going to be completed by Nov 15?
[11/2/2011 4:12:42 PM] Keith Webb: He was trying to get us to switch over to yii
[11/2/2011 4:13:56 PM] Mark Fric: i don't think that would work. according to my experience cooperation of programmers over the internet doesn't work. 
either i'll do the whole project or you (or the) can do it.
[11/2/2011 4:14:22 PM] Keith Webb: ok, do I pay you by the hour or can we agree on a project price?
[11/2/2011 4:15:46 PM] Mark Fric: either way is possible. but if it will be price per project we should agree 100% what will be the final result. there are still many things I don't know right now.
[11/2/2011 4:15:59 PM] Mark Fric: what do you prefer?
[11/2/2011 4:17:42 PM] Keith Webb: is there a possibility that  you could use anything other than the html from the old one once you have the database set up
[11/2/2011 4:18:05 PM] Mark Fric: what exactly do you mean?
[11/2/2011 4:18:40 PM] Mark Fric: html for the webpages or for siteadmin?
[11/2/2011 4:18:56 PM] Keith Webb: just pieces of the regular php
[11/2/2011 4:19:10 PM] Mark Fric: sorry, i still don't understand
[11/2/2011 4:20:46 PM] Mark Fric: can you explain?
[11/2/2011 4:21:22 PM] Keith Webb: [Wednesday, November 02, 2011 4:17 PM] Keith Webb: 

<<< is there a possibility that  you could use anything other than the html from the old one once you have the database set up

<<< not the codeigniter specific code but he pieces of the regular php
[11/2/2011 4:22:13 PM] Mark Fric: i can maybe use some of the code, but I cannot estimate how much of it. things like payment processing etc. can be reused
[11/2/2011 4:22:34 PM] Keith Webb: im on the line with william...hold on
[11/2/2011 4:27:25 PM] Mark Fric: i'll have toleave in 10minutes, i'll be back at around 9pm my time
[11/2/2011 4:28:04 PM] Keith Webb: william said that he will send you an email concerning the affiliate program for the promocast
[11/2/2011 4:29:32 PM] Keith Webb: he wanted me to clarify that we are not trying to sell the system with the affiliate program...we're just using the affiliate program to track the results of individual advertiser offers
[11/2/2011 4:31:19 PM] Mark Fric: ok. we can talk again later, there are few more things to clarify.
i really need to go now
[11/2/2011 4:31:34 PM] Keith Webb: sure...just contact me later...goodbye
[11/2/2011 4:31:43 PM] Mark Fric: sure. bye
[11/2/2011 9:33:17 PM] Mark Fric: hello keith, can we talk?
[11/2/2011 9:34:37 PM] Keith Webb: hey man
[11/2/2011 9:35:01 PM] Keith Webb: sure, let's chat
[11/2/2011 9:35:27 PM] Mark Fric: ok. I checked email from William and you, but I don't understand the tracking at all. You mention vatious commission types (CPA, CPC, CPO, etc.) but I don't see any screen where this is configured in siteadmin.
[11/2/2011 9:42:03 PM] Keith Webb: Ok, I think William is a little confused also... The affiliate (media broker) program for the Promocast system will be a very simple program that allows anyone to sign up and start selling advertising on that system and/or other systems if owned by the same white label reseller.  The siteadmin will be able to enable/disable an auto-approve feature which will automatically generate and send that person a promo (affiliate) code which they will use to sign adverisers up....THATS FOR THE PROMOCAST SYSTEM....What William is talking about is being able to tracking actions, clicks, opens, etc of the ads throughout the system.  This is what will need to be tracked through the backend of HIS PAP system...so there is actually 2 things: 1 affiliate program and 1 tracking program for us
[11/2/2011 9:48:03 PM] Mark Fric: ok. I'm reading the Promocast outline Word Theme - II. Customer - A. Registration
It mentions devices (I assume mobile phones) that are used to register and download the directory. 
I don't understand this part, promocast in the old version is a web applicaton only as far as I understand. What it has to do with mobile phones?
[11/2/2011 9:53:12 PM] Keith Webb: devices=mobile phones.  the system will need to be bookmarked/stored on the mobile phone's home screen.  We are working on wrapping the link within a .jad shell
[11/2/2011 9:53:35 PM] Keith Webb: that is stored on the home screen like an app
[11/2/2011 9:53:51 PM] Keith Webb: if you have any suggestions, that would be great too?!
[11/2/2011 9:54:49 PM] Mark Fric: ok, rightnow I'm trying to understand it. so this application is primary for mobile phones, not for normal computers?
[11/2/2011 9:55:50 PM] Keith Webb: that is 100% correct, but in essence it is a website that is built with responsive technology in order for it to fit ANY SIZE mobile device's screen
[11/2/2011 9:56:46 PM] Keith Webb: they will be accessing it through the wifi function of the phone so we do not have to worry about them using our data plan
[11/2/2011 9:57:47 PM] Mark Fric: ok, maybe I don't understand this responsive technology. is it a part of our application (that has to be developed) or is it something external?
[11/2/2011 10:01:24 PM] Keith Webb: it just means that the screen autoadjust to fit the size of the screen
[11/2/2011 10:04:16 PM] Keith Webb: [Wednesday, November 02, 2011 9:57 PM] Mark Fric: 

<<< ok, maybe I don't understand this responsive technology. is it a part of our application (that has to be developed) or is it something external?
[11/2/2011 10:04:22 PM] Keith Webb: [Wednesday, November 02, 2011 10:03 PM] Trey Brister: 

<<< its already developed
its css files
and timthumb.php for image resizing
[11/2/2011 10:04:39 PM] Mark Fric: ok, the document also mentions some opt-in process for customer registration. I don't undetsrand that. What's the difference between customer and advertiser?
[11/2/2011 10:05:48 PM] Keith Webb: a customer is a person that say "walks into the store" and uses the system for coupons...the advertiser is the person who creates a listing on the system and can create their own coupons
[11/2/2011 10:06:59 PM] Keith Webb: [Wednesday, November 02, 2011 10:06 PM] Trey Brister: 

<<< customer is the shopper that is redeeming a coupon, all they may do on backend is edit their user profile and view their redeemed coupons
[11/2/2011 10:07:31 PM] Keith Webb: [Wednesday, November 02, 2011 10:07 PM] Trey Brister: 

<<< advertiser is the one that is purchasing a listing. He may pay extra for his listing to reside in extra categories or locations
[11/2/2011 10:08:01 PM] Keith Webb: [Wednesday, November 02, 2011 10:07 PM] Trey Brister: 

<<< he may pay extra for more coupons per listing or images per listing
[11/2/2011 10:08:20 PM] Keith Webb: [Wednesday, November 02, 2011 10:08 PM] Trey Brister: 

<<< and pay more to be a featured listing which appears ahead of standard listings in sort order
[11/2/2011 10:08:48 PM] Mark Fric: ok, and the customer has to register somehow to get access to the web pages? is this functionality of promocast?
[11/2/2011 10:09:00 PM] Keith Webb: yes
[11/2/2011 10:10:47 PM] Mark Fric: so it works like this?
Opt-in process (Each device in the mall/center will have its own  keyword)  
1. Consumer enters the store 
2. Device sends them opt-in message 
3. Consumer presses Yes 
4. Device sends them a message (with hidden href device keyword and shortcode information) where they fill in their email address 
5. Has a small terms of service link at the bottom which says that we can do whatever we want with your info 
6. If this is a Call-to-action then you won't have an opportunity to add a link. But if this driven to the web you could put the T&C link on the landing page where they complete the form submit.  Many marketers will require to see the T&C on that page to ensure compliancy.
[11/2/2011 10:10:51 PM] Mark Fric: etc...
[11/2/2011 10:20:17 PM] Keith Webb: We are using Trumpia an sms platform with an api for collection of the customer's information.  Here's the steps:

[11/2/2011 10:39:24 PM] Mark Fric: hm, so i'm most probably missing something in the specification. it is starting to getmore and more complicated.

[11/2/2011 10:50:55 PM] Mark Fric: I'm here, I'm justthinking about it. I'm starting having some doubts. the project is not specified very exactly, I'm not sure if I understand everything that has to be done.
[11/2/2011 10:51:43 PM] Mark Fric: i thought it is a web application - directory and site admin. now there are also smses and customer registration and login
[11/2/2011 10:53:41 PM] Keith Webb: it is a web application, we are only using our sms platform for data collection.  The customer registration is really easy.  trumpia handles that so its really not an issue.  manas can explain how to do it
[4:53:24 PM] Trey Brister: customer is just another user type
[11/2/2011 10:55:34 PM] Mark Fric: ok. is it feasible to make the application without customers, affiliates and smses as the first step? they can be added later after the main core is working. because I cannot estimate these parts now
[11/2/2011 10:57:15 PM] Keith Webb: yes, let's get the core work done and we'll add that later...I promise, it's not difficult
[11/2/2011 11:02:52 PM] Mark Fric: ok, i just don't want to start something that i won't be able to finish. 
I think I understand the core of the application
[11/2/2011 11:03:04 PM] Keith Webb: I will have Trey take that mindmap outline and add how it all integrates and send the file to you...this should REALLY HELP!!!
[11/2/2011 11:03:16 PM] Mark Fric: i have one more question about locations and members
[11/2/2011 11:03:23 PM] Keith Webb: sure
[11/2/2011 11:03:30 PM] Mark Fric: each location is a new white label, right?
[11/2/2011 11:03:41 PM] Keith Webb: yes
[11/2/2011 11:04:06 PM] Mark Fric: an dthere is one admin per everylocation that has access to siteadmin to manage advertisers, listings, etc?
[11/2/2011 11:04:42 PM] Keith Webb: yes
[11/2/2011 11:05:16 PM] Keith Webb: 4 types of users: customer, advertiser, white label admin, super admin

[11/2/2011 11:14:39 PM] Mark Fric: ok, whitelabel admin can create his own locations? or he canonly use locations created by you?
[11/2/2011 11:15:06 PM] Keith Webb: only ones created by us...if he wants a new location...that's another licensing fee
[11/2/2011 11:15:19 PM] Mark Fric: i see
[11/2/2011 11:16:31 PM] Mark Fric: ok. whitelabel admins were not in the old version, right? so they have to be added
[11/2/2011 11:16:49 PM] Keith Webb: yes
[11/2/2011 11:20:16 PM] Keith Webb: the white label admin will basically have access to all of THEIR advertisers, media brokers and customers info, BUT will also be able to  use their own payment gateway and paypal accounts for taking money
[11/2/2011 11:21:04 PM] Keith Webb: and pay their own affiliates/media brokers
[11/2/2011 11:22:34 PM] Mark Fric: ok. I think I need to write down more exact specification. but i'll start working on the system already tomorow. we can continually consult the development to see if I'm going the rigth direction.

have you already talked to your partners and have you decided if I should make the system?
[11/2/2011 11:23:11 PM] Keith Webb: yes, you are the man...everyone has faith in you
[11/2/2011 11:25:58 PM] Mark Fric: ok, great :)
so we'll make the core system without the affiliates, customers, and smses, this functionality will be added later. is it agreed?
also, it is possible that i underestiated some of the things, you should expect that some parts could take more time than estimated.
do you agree to pay me by hour? or do you need to have pricefor the whole project?
[11/2/2011 11:28:20 PM] Keith Webb: yes agreed.  we would like to pay you by the hour, but please see if we can use anything we can from the other code to same some time and money
[11/2/2011 11:28:38 PM] Mark Fric: sure, i'll use everything I can
[11/2/2011 11:29:48 PM] Keith Webb: great...I'll also make sure we get the outline with more integration instructions on it for you

[11/4/2011 3:19:20 AM] Keith Webb: have you made any of the display programming to show any of the new html? Trey has been working hard to complete the front end html and admin html.
[11/4/2011 8:18:35 AM] Mark Fric: not yet, it doesn't go that fast. I'm working on the siteadmin now, but without the new html, I'll add that later
[11/4/2011 10:09:26 PM] Mark Fric: Hello Keith,

I'd like to send you a status report, so that you know what I'm working on.

I made a skeleton application, it is already divided to frontend and siteadmin. Login to siteadmin and adding/editing users already works.
Now I'm working on adding the design to the siteadmin, so that it looks like localbargains HTML.

Making the first basic application goes slowly, because there's a lot of configuration, figuring things out, and I have to do it myself. 
Once the basic framework is ready it will go faster and I'll have a colleague who would be able to do part of the work.

I'll be working partially also during the weekend, I'd like to have something to show you on Monday.
[11/4/2011 10:09:37 PM] Keith Webb: hey man
[11/4/2011 10:09:47 PM] Mark Fric: hello
[11/4/2011 10:10:56 PM] Keith Webb: sounds good, I'm working with Trey to make the front end html look a little better too
[11/4/2011 10:11:45 PM] Mark Fric: ok, how will we combine the work? Are you making only the frontend HTML without any programming?
[11/4/2011 10:11:58 PM] Keith Webb: yes...only html
[11/4/2011 10:12:36 PM] Mark Fric: ok. I'll probably start with frontend next week, but the design can be applied also later
[11/4/2011 10:12:47 PM] Keith Webb: great
[11/4/2011 10:18:48 PM] Mark Fric: ok, it is quite late here, i'll go to bed. tty later
[11/7/2011 2:00:37 PM] Keith Webb: William just sent another email asking if I heard anything from you, so I thought I would just touch base to see how it's coming.
[11/7/2011 8:42:36 PM] Mark Fric: Hello Keith
[11/7/2011 8:42:52 PM] Mark Fric: sorry, I wasn't online in the afternoon
[11/7/2011 8:43:45 PM] Mark Fric: I made some progress during the weekend, I put siteadmin to the new design. Not everything is finished yet, I need a confirmation o some things before I can continue
[11/7/2011 9:09:12 PM] Mark Fric: I'm sending you and William an email, pleas elet me know if you have any comments
[11/8/2011 4:21:42 PM] Mark Fric: Hello Keith, do you have time to talk?
[11/8/2011 4:36:10 PM] Keith Webb: Give me a few minutes.  I've got patients up front, but I'll skype you when I get a break
[11/8/2011 4:36:30 PM] Mark Fric: ok
[11/8/2011 4:54:53 PM] Keith Webb: I'm still not quite done, but I emailed answers to your questions:
[11/8/2011 4:54:56 PM] Keith Webb:     ok, I understand, I have few more questions:

    Question 1 - when you create new whitelabel user (for example McDonalds), should also some default categories/sub-categories be created? If yes, where will these default categories be defined?
    I suggest the following - we can make one default whitelabel user, with default categories/sub-categories, and every time new whitelabel user is created, the categories are copied from this default user.

 
Yes, but with the option to not use the default categories, in which case they must add their own.
There are multiple default category types - Area, Mall, Resort etc. that we have already created.
 


    Question 2 - what is theme? Is it the look of promocast frontend? I haven't seen its editation anywhere in the siteadmin.
    So do you want to allow every whitelabel user his own theme for frontend? 

 
No, only basic branding is free - The white label clients will have the ability to put their own company name at the top of the Promocast system
Semi custom theme. (Purchased)
Or semi custom theme based on CSS entered into a textarea on the backend.
 
Custom Theme (Purchased)
White label clients can purchase the option to have their own custom theme.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5145422/theming-in-yii-framework
Options?
Link to download sample theme zip and upload their modified theme zip OR pay us to design the custom theme. 
Themes, If purchased may apply to Location, Category, Listing, or White Label System.
 


    Question 3 - do you want to have plans made in the way as in HTML specification, with Plans and Limit plans? 
    Plans are applied only to whitelabel user (like max locations) or also to advertiser (like max. number of listings)?

 
Please see: 
http://mymallcoupons.com/site-admin/Plans.php
 

    Question 4 - I assume whitelabel user can be signed up to one plan only, right? 
    There's no information of which plan whitelabel user has right now, so I'll probably have to add it to the Whitelabel account.

One license = One plan, but a white label admin may purchase multiple plans if they want more than one white label systems.
[11/8/2011 5:02:18 PM] Mark Fric: we should make this clear - one license = one plan or one license = one location?
the easiest would be to have whitelabel admin = whitelabel system = one plan
if he wants to create more whitelabel systems, we'd have to create multiple whitelabel admins wth different usernames
[11/8/2011 5:16:27 PM] Mark Fric: sorry, disregard my previous comment, I got it now. I'm sending you an email
[11/8/2011 5:17:20 PM] Keith Webb: ok, I'm here
[11/8/2011 5:17:30 PM] Mark Fric: ok, i just sent youan email
[11/8/2011 5:17:42 PM] Keith Webb: k
[11/8/2011 5:21:03 PM] Mark Fric: i have a little problem that there isn't exact specification of the project, and I'm not sure if you want to have it the way I'm developing it. 
For example plans for whitelabel users - they are not specified anywhere. 
now i got that whitelist account must have plan assigned
[11/8/2011 5:24:11 PM] Keith Webb: yes, to start keep it simple and do NOT worry about themes, etc for now
[11/8/2011 5:25:25 PM] Keith Webb: The cross publications, will NOT be a big deal to start but once several hundred promocast systems are in place - it will be a VERY BIG DEAL.  But its low priority for now
[11/8/2011 5:26:12 PM] Keith Webb: I agree, there will be some default categories that the white label admin can choose from
[11/8/2011 5:26:47 PM] Keith Webb: To start, I would suggest the Mall categories and the Area categories
[11/8/2011 5:27:12 PM] Keith Webb: YES "whitelabel admin = whitelabel system = one plan"
[11/8/2011 5:27:24 PM] Mark Fric: ok. do you still have to make the presentaiton of the system on 15th?
[11/8/2011 5:28:15 PM] Keith Webb: They understand our situation and would like to at least have a somewhat functioning product that they could play around with online "online demo"
[11/8/2011 5:28:29 PM] Keith Webb: but it doesn't need all the bells and whistles
[11/8/2011 5:29:32 PM] Mark Fric: I see. Is it a customer who wants to purchase whitelabel site license?
[11/8/2011 5:31:15 PM] Keith Webb: yes, we have several, but the one that was for the 15th had told Wal-Mart that it would be available by the 15th because Wal-Mart was wanting to use it in their stores before the Christmas season
[11/8/2011 5:32:58 PM] Mark Fric: ok. I'll do my bestto make most of the functionality until 15th
[11/8/2011 5:34:38 PM] Mark Fric: sorry, I have to leave now, we can chat later. I know everything to continue with development for the next few days.
[11/10/2011 12:02:54 AM] Keith Webb: Hey Maros, just thought I'd get an update if you were around
[11/10/2011 3:19:53 PM] Keith Webb: Any update?
[11/10/2011 10:34:44 PM] Keith Webb: Hey Maros...any news?
[3:00:23 PM] Mark Fric: hello Keith
[3:01:36 PM] Keith Webb: hey man
[3:01:51 PM] Mark Fric: yesterday we finished advertisers and locations, partly also listings. Today I'm working on the frontend, but it will take some time.
[3:02:30 PM] Mark Fric: I'm not sure I'll manage to make at least the first version of frontend tody
[3:03:26 PM] Keith Webb: is there anything we can do to help...I know Trey's got the front end html completed except for the reporting
[3:04:55 PM] Mark Fric: no, i don't see anything you can do to help, we simply have to programm it. but now I have also a colleague working on it part time together with me
[3:05:56 PM] Keith Webb: Ok great...that one Russian programmer that uses yii is still available...Trey said he was VERY good...are you interested in working with him?
[3:09:56 PM] Mark Fric: hm, no. it is very difficult to coordinate programming work over the internet.

maybe he could do some things that are separate components, like the hierarchical grid component that supports drag & drop sorting. 
but it would be better to involve him after 15th, because I don't really have time now
[3:11:44 PM] Keith Webb: 1. will each whitelabel  account run on its own domain or subdomain? YES
[3:11:58 PM] Keith Webb: 2. does location also have its own subdomain? YES
[3:13:24 PM] Keith Webb: 3. when the visitor opens the web, what location should be displayed to him initially? The default location is the first location that the white label admin creates.  If something happens to where that is not available, it should default to our main url
[3:14:42 PM] Mark Fric: ok, thanks for the answers
[3:16:26 PM] Keith Webb: PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU ARE PULLING THE LATEST UPDATED HTML FROM MYMALLCOUPONS.COM
[3:17:11 PM] Mark Fric: ok.
one more question - if each location has its own subdomain, where is this subdomain specified? is if t the location name? what if the name contains spaces or unallowed characters?
